# Tip Calculator
My first Android application. Might come in handy some day I suppose?

Thanks to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkYIMZw9gzQ) and some other tip calculators on Play Store for reference.

Yeah, there is already a lot of tip caculators, but I just want to implement a tip calculator in my own way.

I don't bother coming up with a fancy name to call it because **tip calculator** is probably the first keyword we would think of when we need one?

# Features
What do you expect?
* Calculate tip -- duh.
* Able to select tip percentage
* Split bill
* Immediate calculation -- no need to press the ugly "Calculate" button
* Not exactly a feature but I guess it looks cooler than some other tip calculators?
